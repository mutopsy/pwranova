Description: Provides functions for conducting power analysis in ANOVA 
    designs, including between-, within-, and mixed-factor designs, 
    with full support for both main effects and interactions. 
    The package allows calculation of statistical power, 
    required total sample size, significance level, and minimal 
    detectable effect sizes expressed as partial eta squared or Cohen's f 
    for ANOVA terms and planned contrasts. 
    In addition, complementary functions are included for common related 
    tests such as t-tests and correlation tests, making the package a 
    convenient toolkit for power analysis in experimental psychology 
    and related fields.
