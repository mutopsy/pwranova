# pwranova 1.0.0 (2025-09-28)

* First stable release of the package.

* Provides power analysis functions for:
  - Between-, within-, and mixed-factor ANOVA designs (main effects and interactions).
  - Planned contrasts with user-defined weights.
  - t-tests (one-sample, paired, and two-sample).
  - Pearson correlations (using either the t-distribution or Fisher’s z-transformation).

* Supports solving for:
  - Statistical power
  - Required total sample size
  - Significance level (alpha)
  - Minimal detectable effect size (Cohen’s f, partial eta squared, or Cohen’s d-type indices).

* Validated against G*Power for supported ANOVA designs, t-tests, and correlation tests.
